## Project Description

Welcome to the **Pet Adoption Project**! This web application allows users to browse adoptable pets, like or dislike them, and make a donation for each like. The user can interact with a gallery of pets, and each like will contribute $1 towards the pet's care. Additionally, the application plays different sounds for different animals (dog or cat sounds) and even a sad sound when a pet is unliked. It's a fun and interactive way to show support for animal adoption!

The application uses React for the front end and features sound effects, animations, and hover effects to make the user experience more engaging.

### Features:

- **Like & Dislike**: Users can like or dislike a pet, which will update their adoption status and trigger a donation.
- **JavaScript**: Core programming language used throughout the project to handle dynamic content, form submissions, authentication, routing, and more.
- **Donation Tracking**: Each like contributes $1 to the total donation for the pets.
- **Sound Effects**: Different sounds play when interacting with cats or dogs, and a sad sound plays when a like is removed.
- **Interactive Animations**: Hover effects on pet images for a more engaging user experience.
- **Mobile Responsive**: The application adjusts to fit various screen sizes for a smooth experience on mobile devices.
